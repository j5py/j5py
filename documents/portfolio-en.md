## Executive Summary


**Developer expert in Tracking and Security, the perfect choice for those who value insatiable curiosity and lifelong learning**.

Having explored different roles across an agency, a publisher, and a startup, I have confirmed a strong preference for primarily technical roles. Evolving from entry-level jobs to my last roles has demonstrated a strong ability to learn. Now, after a rich self-taught journey, I prioritize job stability and aim to grow with a company for our mutual success. I am mainly targeting fully remote positions while recognizing the value of occasional in-person meetings to foster better connections; therefore, I am also open to hybrid opportunities.

Growing through my journey with the CyberPass platform by Red Alert Labs for connected product security compliance.

###### First Quarter

During the first quarter of my one-year fixed-term contract, **I adapted to an intricate environment using TypeScript, React, and Node.js, building on my JavaScript foundation**. I was involved in improving quality in both backend and frontend environments, focusing on error management, Express object typing, model typing, and code conventions. I evolved through the integration of TanStack React Query across numerous components, tackling challenges related to UI and data integrity. I also troubleshot issues with Ant Design tables and enhanced language and pagination management while navigating the GitHub collaborative workflow, including my first advanced merge conflict.

Besides adapting to a broader and far more complex context than I had previously encountered, which was both expected and challenging, I relied on my **analytical thinking to improve resolution times** while evolving in a sometimes uncertain environment with occasional guidance. In a few simpler tasks, **I aimed to structure project management and its change flow to enhance communication**, as well as related quality assessments, to better track progress in web integration.

#### Employment 2024

Following a period of personal growth and increased self-awareness, I aimed to explore my human qualities in a professional context. Through these experiences, I gained insights into my aspirations: **writing code makes me happy and fulfilled**. Until now, I had mostly taken service-oriented roles, which often felt misaligned with my true focus on technical excellence. **I am eager to shift towards Web Development**, where my technical strengths can finally shine in a role that truly reflects my skills and interests.

##### Customer Success for a Startup

> _Technologies that were essential and/or new to me at this stage_

From September to November, at a high-growth startup, my expertise was anticipated to support the scale of an ambitious AI-powered speech-to-text API based on Whisper, Gladia. Although my technical abilities were valued, the role primarily demanded immediate leadership expertise, and the scope of client requests was broad across several entry points. This short experience was a valuable lesson; **I realized that my strengths lie more in technical problem-solving than in shining at interpersonal dynamics**. I thrive in environments where I can focus on delivering effective solutions and tackling complex challenges behind the scenes.

##### Assistant/Intern for a Bootcamp

In July, I undertook a brief freelance mission as a Teacher Assistant at Jedha Bootcamp, where I provided foundational knowledge to beginners, explaining concepts to help them grasp more advanced techniques delivered by the instructors. As **I needed to transition into a stable full-time position** after nearly 18 months of professional development, I couldn't fully dedicate myself to a role that required significantly more time and personal investment than a part-time internship.

###### Continuing My Progression by Completing Advanced Front-End Skills, April to August

I followed a comprehensive path by Meta on Coursera while engaging in freelance work in a different field, focusing on _React Basics_ and _Advanced React_. Learning React was particularly rewarding, enabling me to create dynamic user interfaces that significantly enhance user experience.

###### Enhancing My Backend and Cloud Technology Skills, January to April

After reviewing my foundation in Client-side Development, I shifted my focus to Infrastructure Technologies, specifically studying Backend and Cloud Technologies on Coursera with _Get Started with Cloud Native, DevOps, Agile, and NoSQL_, _Developing Back-End Apps with Node.js and Express_, and _Containers with Docker, Kubernetes & OpenShift_ by IBM, along with NoSQL by MongoDB. I was driven to engage with Cloud-native Development, an essential approach for building scalable applications today.

###### Building on My Development Expertise After a Focus on Security, January

Recognizing that Information Security requires extensive expertise across all software, languages, and environments, I considered my interest in Penetration Testing. While I remain stimulated by the field, **I prefer contributing to the development of solutions that have a long-term impact and address specific needs** rather than engaging in the often abstract and complex nature of Vulnerability Assessments. I decided to capitalize on my existing knowledge and pursue **what motivates me the most: writing code and designing efficient logic**. I revisited my fundamentals to solidify them through Coursera with the courses _AJAX for Web Developers_, _Modern JavaScript Iterators and Generators_, and the _Intermediate Web and Front-End Development_ pathway by IBM.

###### Deepening Knowledge with Comprehensive Penetration Testing Training, from May

Theoretical courses, practical exercises, and continuous assessment were essential during and after the initial bootcamp to forge my understanding of the concepts. On TryHackMe, I completed the courses _Introduction to Cyber Security_, _Pre Security_, and _Web Fundamentals_, followed by the _Jr Penetration Tester_ path, of which 90% was completed in 2023 before prioritizing studies in Cloud Technologies and Web Development. Determined to see it through, I achieved it in April 2024 after a thorough review. I also spent a few days on Hack The Box.

###### Strengthening Foundations Alongside the Bootcamp, May to August

From the first weeks of the bootcamp, I was immediately challenged with critical topics that required rapid skill acquisition. Each day in parallel on Coursera, I followed the _Specialization in Python for Everybody_ by _University of Michigan_, and then completed _Introduction to TCP/IP_ by _Yonsei University_. I also began the _Technical Support Fundamentals_ path by Google to gain knowledge in hardware concepts, which I have paused for now.

###### Offensive Security Bootcamp, from Early April to End of July

At Jedha Bootcamp, I focused on Kali Linux for Vulnerability Assessments, supported by courses and guidance from instructors who provided a hands-on approach through various labs. The program offered an in-depth exploration of Web and Network Security, equipping students with a solid understanding of Firewalls, VPNs, and Intrusion Detection Systems. It covered Penetration Testing techniques and tools such as Burp Suite, Nmap, Metasploit, and Wireshark, as well as numerous command-line tools accessible from GitHub. Additionally, I acquired knowledge in Incident Response, Threat Analysis, Forensics, and Open Source Intelligence.

###### Prior Training about Linux User Essentials, February to March

Having proactively managed administrative tasks to start my training as soon as possible, I spent the last few weeks on Coursera refining my foundations with _Command Line Basics in Linux_, discovering _Introduction to Bash Shell Scripting_, and exploring _Practical Vim Editor Commands on Linux_ (anticipating scenarios where interaction with this editor is the only option).

##### Technical Support for a Publisher

Hired as a Consultant at Commanders Act, which has evolved into a Customer Data Platform since, I was offered the opportunity to join Support due to my Frontend and Analytics expertise. I provided guidance on implementation choices, needs analysis, debugging, diagnosis, advice, solution proposals, Responsive Web Development, and processed routine tasks in Account Access Management.

###### JavaScript Solutions

Given the diversity of environments and the constant evolution of third-party libraries, editing or adding custom JavaScript in Data Collection is often necessary. Since every Tag Management System, including TagCommander, only covers the most common use cases, adding advanced logic to meet specific needs is essential. **I provided clean, efficient, and easy-to-maintain code, which has contributed to the smooth operation of the company** by assisting clients and consultants with their configurations.

###### TMS, JavaScript, CMP and GDPR Implementation Guide

The intricacies of consent cycles and triggering third-party solutions, along with Google Tag Manager specifics, make any implementation complex. Questions were frequent, and **documenting this topic met many expectations to facilitate the adoption of TrustCommander**, the Consent Management Platform, in accordance with CNIL and GDPR requirements. The document _TrustCommander into Google Tag Manager_ **proved useful for many clients, streamlining the work of internal consultants**. I simplified concepts during dedicated sessions when needed, receiving excellent feedback.

###### Support Response Library

To address the recurrence of topics (routines, common issues, or industry changes) and free up time for more advanced resolutions, refine responses, and eliminate errors, **I took the initiative to optimize. To maintain a collection of text responses and JavaScript codes** aimed at continuous improvement with versioning, I created a private repository on a dedicated GitHub account. Although I had accumulated the files, this personal solution required a collaborative approach to be completed. I handed over all the files to the Product Owner upon my departure.

##### Development/CRO for an Agency

The data agency fifty-five, founded by former Google Europe executives, aims to help major players leverage their data. As a Tracking Specialist, **I quickly expanded my role** and was entrusted with projects in Conversion Rate Optimization, requiring Responsive Web Design skills and my expertise in JavaScript. To support my growth, I completed online courses primarily on Google Tag Manager and Google Analytics. I also studied UX to refine my A/B Testing skills and, **thinking about the future, AWS to enhance my strengths as a Web Developer** by exploring EC2, AMI, ELB, EBS, S3, IAM, Route53, and Lambda.

###### Node.js App for Documenting GTM's Added JavaScript Logic

Some logics are sophisticated, and Tag Management Systems are used by profiles not familiar with JavaScript, such as marketing teams. My former manager suggested exploring a **documentation generator to provide detailed information on specific functions**. I delivered a Node.js app coupled with a REST API, using JSDoc to generate documentation about the JavaScript enhancing Google Tag Manager. This involved refactoring the existing code before development to enable the use of Annotations, and also writing explanatory descriptions. The project was **approved and praised** by the CTO.

###### Car Picker CRO Advanced Personalization Experience

Consulted for a major modification of the Renault France homepage, the agency's most important client at the time, I confirmed the feasibility of **a test involving data spread across different pages**. After determining the possibility of cloning elements from product pages in Local Storage and reconstructing them by integrating CTAs (Call to Action) and Tracking (along with creating Google Analytics segments), I structured the required JavaScript into different Google Tag Manager tags within a precise scope to avoid impacting performance. Interactive and engaging, displaying vehicles viewed during the active session (and previous ones) before any other content, **the experience showed a significantly higher conversion rate than the control version**, leading the client to commission new Conversion Rate Optimization experiences for a substantial amount.

###### JavaScript Solutions

Tag Management Systems facilitate the orchestration of third-party solutions by providing an entry point through a container script, but they only cover the most common cases. I offered simple and reliable solutions, with numerous JavaScript snippets to address various needs.

##### Web Development

Following a 3-month Web Development Bootcamp with WebForce3 (covering the basics in HTML, programming with JavaScript, procedural and object-oriented PHP, MySQL, Git, Bootstrap, and more), I delved deeper into each subject for over a year on the online platform OpenClassrooms to fully grasp the concepts (completing numerous certificates, each consisting of lessons, quizzes, exercises, and a final assignment). Pushing through *Eloquent JavaScript 3rd edition (2018)* while job hunting was key to securing my first role.

###### Symfony Final Project

As a capstone project, I developed a CV website using Symfony 3, **my very first online application**. While I don't recall the hosting provider, I remember configuring an Apache HTTP Server. I also implemented a messaging feature with jQuery and SQL, allowing users to chat, along with a timed game where players had to drag and drop bills into a bank while avoiding a controller that would decrease their score. The responsive frontend was created with custom CSS. Although I didn't keep the code from that time, you can visit an archive of [sylvaindemaimay.com/sitemap on The Wayback Machine (Texts in French)](https://web.archive.org/web/20180824130531/http://sylvaindemaimay.com/sitemap), where I expressed a strong interest in security and the potential of data. My curiosity and commitment to understanding these areas have guided my career development, rooted in documentaries on societal subjects and science fiction films that offer inspiration with a prospective view.

> [!NOTE]
> **Only the frontend could be archived**.

> _Because the server-side logic cannot be copied, you won't be able to see a form processed, access the chat, or play the game. Additionally, the burger icon can't be rendered on this scraped version, which is why the URL points to the Sitemap._
